Time and Date Information Scripts:
    There are two programs. 
    One (timedate_scripts.py) has all of the programs that put the inputted (beggining and end) dates/times into any format that will be used by a program.
    The second (time_compile.py) compiles all of these formats into a list that will be created in the csv compiler and called to for use via all of the surf data collecting programs.


Data Grabbing Scripts:
    Tide 
    Wind 
    Swell 
    Survey


Main Scripts:
    csv_compile.py
        This program starts by running the time_compile script which outputs a list of times and dates that will be called to later in the script.
        There is a key for these formats at the top of the time_compile.py script that lists each format with its list index.
        These list elements are then called as inputs to the data collecting scripts.
        Each of these data collecting scripts is then run and put into a list.
        The order for this list has a key at the top of the csv_compile.py script. 
        This list will be put into a csv row at the end of the data collecting.
